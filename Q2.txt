Java: More verbose. Requires explicit type declarations and more boilerplate code.
      Primarily object-oriented. Introduced functional programming features in Java 8 (like lambdas and the Stream API).
     Statically typed with explicit type declarations.
                       int number = 5;
      

Scala: More concise and expressive. Uses type inference to reduce boilerplate code.
       Combines object-oriented and functional programming paradigms. Encourages immutability and first-class functions.
       Statically typed with advanced type inference, allowing concise code without sacrificing type safety.
                val number = 5
